People are warned that what they post on the internet will live forever. But that’s not really the case.

<p>This year the <a href="https://anniversary.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> turns 25. It’s best known for its
    pioneering role in archiving the internet through the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>, which
    allows users to see how websites looked in the past. </p>

<p>Increasingly, much of daily life is conducted online. School, work, communication with friends and family, as well as
    news and images, are accessed through a variety of websites. Information that once was printed, physically mailed or
    kept in photo albums and notebooks may now be available only online. The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed even more
    interactions to the web. </p>

<p>You may not realize portions of the internet are constantly disappearing. As <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=tOu7IyUAAAAJ">librarians</a> <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=o-1tqcMAAAAJ">and</a> <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=YBgTrPMAAAAJ">archivists</a>, we strengthen collective
    memory by preserving materials that document the cultural heritage of society, including on the web. You can help us
    save the internet, too, as a citizen archivist. </p>

<h2>Disappearing act</h2>

<p>People and organizations remove content from the web for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it’s a result of changing
    internet culture, such as the recent <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/technology/yahoo-answers-shutting-down.html">shutdown of Yahoo
        Answers</a>. </p>

<p>It can also be a result of following best practices for website design. When a website is updated, for example, the
    previous version is overwritten – unless it was archived.</p>

<p>Web archiving is the process of collecting, preserving and providing continued access to information on the internet.
    Often this work is done by librarians and archivists, with assistance from automated technology like web crawlers.
</p>

<p>Web crawlers are programs that index web pages to make them available through search engines, or for long-term
    preservation. The Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization, uses thousands of computer servers to save multiple
    digital copies of these pages, requiring <a href="https://archive.org/about/">over 70 petabytes of data</a>. It is
    funded through donations, grants and payments for its digitization services. Over <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19avU5I3qi-EUjDpNSWaN7HTBlq0oD93EtwOnukFM8gY/edit">750 million web
        pages are captured per day</a> in the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.</p>

<h2>Why archive?</h2>

<p>In 2018, President Donald Trump <a
        href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ap-fact-check-trump-wrongly-claims-google-shunned-speech">wrongly
        claimed via Twitter</a> that Google had promoted on its homepage President Barack Obama’s State of the Union
    address, but not his own. Archived versions of the Google homepage proved that Google had, in fact, <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180131023314/http://www.google.com/">highlighted Trump’s State of the Union
        address</a> in the same manner. Multiple news outlets use the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine as the source
    for fact-checking these types of claims, since screenshots alone can be easily altered.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/the-dire-state-of-news-archiving-in-the-digital-age.php">A 2019
        report from the Tow Center for Digital Journalism</a> examined the digital archiving practices and policies of
    newspapers, magazines and other news producers. The interviews revealed that many news media staff either do not
    have the resources to devote to archiving their work or misunderstand digital archiving by equating it to having a
    backup version. </p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gawker-archives-freedom-of-press-foundation-toast-la-weekly/">a news story
        disappeared from the Gawker website</a> a year after the publication shut down, the <a
        href="https://freedom.press/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> became concerned with what might happen when
    wealthy individuals purchase websites with the intent to delete or censor the archives. It partnered with the
    Internet Archive to launch a <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/9790">web archive collection</a> focused on
    preserving the web archives of vulnerable news outlets – and to dissuade billionaires from purchasing such material
    to censor.</p>

<p>Archiving websites that document social justice issues, such as <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com">Black Lives
        Matter</a>, helps explain these movements to people of the present and the future. </p>

<p>Archiving government websites promotes transparency and accountability. Especially during times of transition,
    government websites are vulnerable to deletion with changing political parties. </p>

<p>In 2017 <a
        href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/26/573609499/library-of-congress-will-no-longer-archive-every-tweet">the
        Library of Congress announced</a> it would no longer archive every single tweet, because of Twitter’s growth as
    a communication tool. Twitter supplies the Library of Congress with the texts of tweets, not shared images or
    videos. Instead of comprehensive collecting, the Library of Congress now archives only tweets of significant
    national importance.</p>

<p>Archived websites that document the culture and history of the internet, like <a
        href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7jzgm/the-geocities-archive-is-bringing-the-early-internet-to-life">the
        Geocities Gallery</a>, not only are fun to look at but illustrate the ways early websites were created and used
    by individuals. </p>

<h2>Citizen archivists</h2>

<p>Archiving the internet is a monumental task, one that librarians and archivists cannot do alone. Anyone can be a
    citizen archivist and preserve history through the <a href="https://www.archive.org/web/">Internet Archive’s Wayback
        Machine</a>. The “<a href="https://web.archive.org/save/">Save Page Now</a>” feature allows anyone to freely
    archive a single, public website page. Bear in mind, some websites prevent web crawling and archiving through
    special coding or by requiring a login to the site. This may be due to sensitive content or the personal preference
    of the web developer.</p>

<p>Local cultural heritage institutions, such as libraries, archives and museums, are also actively archiving the
    internet. Over 800 institutions use <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a>, a tool from the Internet
    Archive, to create archived web collections. At the <a href="https://archive-it.org/home/udayton">University of
        Dayton</a> we curate collections related to our Catholic and Marianist heritage, from Catholic blogs to stories
    of the Virgin Mary in the news.</p>

<p>Through its <a href="https://archive-it.org/blog/projects/spontaneous-events/">Spontaneous Event collections</a>,
    Archive-It partners with organizations and individuals to create collections of “web content related to a specific
    event, capturing at risk content during times of crisis.” </p>

<p>Similarly, it created the <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/">Community Webs program</a>, in partnership
    with the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>, to help public libraries
    create collections of archived web content relevant to local communities.</p>

<p>The websites of today are the historical evidence of tomorrow, but only if they are archived. If they are lost, we
    will lose crucial information about corporate and government decisions, modern communication methods such as social
    media, and social movements with significant online presences, such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. </p>
</p>
<p> Together with librarians and archivists, you can help ensure the survival of this evidence and save internet
history.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag. Please DO NOT REMOVE. --><img
